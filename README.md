This is python file containing codes for questions given here: Questions 1: Create an empty list. Accept 10 numbers from the user and append to it the list if it is an even number. Questions 2: Create a notebook on LIST COMPREHENSION. This exercise is to put you in a Self learning mode Questions 3: write a program that generates a dictionary d which contains (i, i*i), where i is from 1 to n (both included). Then you have to just print this dictionary d. Example: Input: 4 will give output as {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16} Questions 4: There is a robot which wants to go the charging point to charge itself. The robot moves in a 2-D plane from the original point (0,0). The robot can move toward UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT with given steps. The trace of robot movement is shown as the following: UP 5 DOWN 3 LEFT 3 RIGHT 2 Then, the output of the program should be: 2 The numbers after the direction are steps. Write a program to compute the distance between the current position after a sequence of movement and original point. If the distance is a float, then just print the nearest integer (use round() function for that and then convert it into an integer).
